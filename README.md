# My Project

I created a unique exhibit using 625 Rubik's cubes, featuring portraits of Indian scientists Srinivasa Ramanujan and CV Raman. What's unique about it is that you can see one scientist's picture from one side of the mosiac frame and the other scientist's picture from the other side. Inspired by the math behind Rubik's cube, I developed a Python code to ensure accurate cube configurations and color arrangement of the Rubik's cube pieces. Solving cubes with dual-sided pictures was challenging, but I figured out some tricks to make it work. This project blends creativity, logic, and a love for art and science.
